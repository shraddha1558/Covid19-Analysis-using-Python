<h2>Introduction:</h2>
This project entails a comprehensive analysis of COVID-19 data, conducted in two phases.
<br>
<b>Phase 1: </b>Worldwide Data Analysis (22/01/2020 to 23/03/2020)

In this phase, the analysis focuses on worldwide COVID-19 data spanning from January 22, 2020, to March 23, 2020. The objective is to gain insights into the global spread and impact of the virus during this period.

<b>Phase 2: </b> Detailed Analysis of Indian States
Phase 2 delves deeper into the COVID-19 situation by examining data from specific regions, namely Indian states. By analyzing data from these regions separately, we aim to understand the unique characteristics of the virus spread and response strategies employed.

Analysis Approach:
<br>
<b>Phase 1 Analysis:</b> 
The analysis begins with a worldwide perspective, examining trends, geographical distribution, and key metrics such as confirmed cases, active cases, recoveries, and deaths.

<b>Phase 2 Analysis:</b>  
Subsequently, the focus shifts to a more granular level, analyzing data from Indian states individually. This involves exploring trends over time, identifying hotspots, and comparing the progression of the pandemic across different regions.
Through meticulous data analysis and visualization, this project aims to provide valuable insights into the dynamics of the COVID-19 pandemic on a global scale as well as within specific regions. By understanding the patterns and trends observed in the data, we can better inform decision-making processes and public health interventions aimed at controlling the spread of the virus and mitigating its impact.
